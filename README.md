# Horiseon

A single page website for the marketing agency "Horizeon" originally created with CSS and HTML. 

## Motivation

The original source code of the website did not meet accessibility standards. It had a couple of link related bugs and some aesthetic issues. I organized the code of both the CSS and HTML documents so that they followed a semantic structure and I fixed any broken links. I used CSS to update the front end of the website to make sure that the design was as user friendly and as professional looking as possible. I also added alt attributes to the images within the HTML for accessibility purposes.
